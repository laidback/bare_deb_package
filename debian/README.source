# 1. Generate the fully patched source, in a form ready for editing,
# 	that would be built to create Debian packages. Doing this with
# 	a patch target in debian/rules is recommanded.
# 2. Modify the source and save those modifications so they will be
# 	applied when building the package.
# 3. Remove source modifications that are currently being applied
# 	when building the package.
# 4. Optionally, document what steps are necessary to upgrade the
# 	Debian source package to a new upstream version, if applicable.
