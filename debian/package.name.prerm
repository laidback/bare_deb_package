#!/bin/bash

# All command scripts, including maintainer scripts inside the package
# and used by dpkg, should have a #! line naming the shell to be executed
# to interpret them

# Shell scripts (sh and bash) other than init.d scripts shoud almost
# certainly start with set -e so that errors are detected. Alternatively
# you could check the exit status of *every* command.
